    <h1>Programming Languages</h1>
    <p><ul type = "square"><li>A programming language is a formal system of instructions used by humans to communicate with computers and create software, websites, applications, and more.</li>
    <li>Like human languages, each has its own unique syntax (rules) and structure, enabling developers to translate human logic and algorithms into machine-executable code.</li></ul></p>
    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
    <ul type = "circle">
        <li>Purpose:
            The primary function of a programming language is to provide a precise and structured way to tell a computer what tasks to perform to solve a problem. Computers operate using binary code (1s and 0s), which is difficult for humans to write; programming languages bridge this gap by using human-readable words and symbols that are later translated into binary.</li>
        <li>Translation: Code written in a programming language (source code) must be translated into machine code before a computer's CPU can execute it.<br> This is done by a:<br>
        <ul type  = disc>
            <li>Compiler: Translates the entire source code into machine code before the program runs (e.g., C, C++).</li>
        <li>Interpreter: Translates and executes the code line by line at runtime (e.g., Python, JavaScript). </li>
        </ul></li>

    <h3 id = c>C:</h3>
    <p>The C programming language is a powerful, general-purpose, and procedural language developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It is highly valued for its efficiency and low-level memory access, making it a foundational language in computer science. </p>
    <h4>Key Features:</h4>
    <ul type = circle>
        <li><b>Procedural:</b> C organizes programs into functions (procedures) to perform specific tasks, promoting a structured approach to problem-solving.</li>
        <li><b>Efficient and Fast:</b>C is a compiled language, meaning its source code is translated directly into machine code, resulting in fast execution speeds.</li>
        <li><b>Portable:</b> C programs can be compiled and run on a wide variety of computer systems and operating systems with minimal modification, thanks to the ANSI C standard.</li>
        <li><b>Low-Level Access:</b>It provides direct access to computer memory through the use of pointers, which is crucial for system programming and embedded systems.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>A Simple <q>Hello, World!</q> Program:</h4>
    <pre><code>
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    int main() {
        printf("Hello, World!\n");
        return 0;
    }
    </code></pre>

    <hr>
    <h3 id = c++>C++:</h3>
    <p>C++ is a powerful, high-performance, general-purpose programming language developed as an extension of the C language to add object-oriented programming (OOP) features. </p>
    <h4>Key Features:</h4>
    <ul type = circle>
        <li><b>Multi-Paradigm:</b>C++ supports several programming styles, including procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming.</li>
        <li><b>High Performance:</b>It provides a high level of control over system resources and memory, resulting in fast and efficient execution speeds, which is crucial for performance-critical applications like game engines and operating systems.</li>
        <li><b>Memory Management:</b>It provides a high level of control over system resources and memory, resulting in fast and efficient execution speeds, which is crucial for performance-critical applications like game engines and operating systems.</li>
        <li><b>Portability:</b>Code written in C++ can be compiled and run on a wide variety of platforms and operating systems with minimal changes.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>A Simple <q>Hello, World!</q> Program:</h4>
    <pre><code>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    using namespace std;
    int main() {
        cout<<"Hello, World!\n";
        return 0;
    }
    </code></pre>

    <h3 id = python>Python:</h3>
    <p>Python is a popular, high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its readability and simple, English-like syntax. Created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991, it emphasizes clean code and uses significant indentation to define code blocks.</p>
    <h4>Key Features:</h4>
    <ul type = circle>
        <li><b>Easy to Learn and Use:</b>Python's simple structure and few keywords make it an ideal first language for beginners and professionals alike.</li>
        <li><b>Versatile:</b>It is used across various domains, from web development and software testing to data science, artificial intelligence (AI), and automation.</li>
        <li><b>Extensive Libraries and Frameworks:</b>Python has a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow) and frameworks (e.g., Django, Flask) that save developers time by providing pre-written code for complex tasks.</li>
        <li><b>Interpretered Language:</b>Code is executed line by line at runtime, which allows for quick prototyping and easy debugging without a separate compilation step.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>A Simple <q>Hello, World!</q> Program:</h4>
    <pre><code>
    print("Hello, World!")
    </code></pre>

    <h3 id = java>Java:</h3>
    <p>Java is a widely used, high-level, object-oriented programming language designed to be portable across multiple platforms with the core principle of "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA). Developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in 1995, it is now owned by Oracle Corporation and powers billions of devices globally.</p>
    <h4>Key Features:</h4>
    <ul type = circle>
        <li><b>Platform Independent:</b>Java code is compiled into an intermediate format called bytecode, which can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, regardless of the underlying operating system.</li>
        <li><b>Object-Oriented(OOP):</b>JJava organizes programs around classes and objects, promoting modularity, reusability, and scalability through principles like inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.</li>
        <li><b>Robustness and Security:</b>Java features strong memory management, automatic garbage collection (eliminating common C/C++ memory errors), and exception handling, which makes applications reliable and secure.</li>
        <li><b>Simplicity and Familarity:</b>Its syntax is similar to C and C++, making it relatively easy for experienced programmers to learn, while its clean design makes it a good first language for beginners.</li>
    </ul>
